            <li>8 cups chicken stock or broth</li>

            <li>1/4 cup fresh parsely(finely chopped)</li>
            <li>water(as needed)</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onions, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring every few minutes until the vegetables begin to soften; 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the garlic, bay leaves, and thyme. Cook, while stirring the garlic around the pan, for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the chicken stock and bring to a low simmer. Taste the soup then adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Depending on the stock used, you might need to add 1 or more teaspoons of salt.</li>
        <li>Submerge the chicken thighs into the soup so that the broth covers them. Bring the soup back to a low simmer then partially cover the pot with a lid and cook, stirring a few times until the chicken thighs are cooked through; about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>If, during this time, the broth seems low, add a splash more stock or a bit of water. Turn the heat to medium-low.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked chicken to a plate. Stir the noodles into the soup and cook until done, 6 to 10 minutes depending on the type of noodles used.</li>
        <li>While the noodles cook, shred the chicken into strips or dice into cubes. Slide the chicken back into the pot and then taste the soup once more for seasoning. Adjust with more salt and pepper, as needed. Stir in the parsley and serve.</li>
    </ol>
